#CODING STANDARDS

Comments
-> TODOs should include the string. TODO in all caps, followed by the name, e-mail address, or other identifier of the person who can best provide context about the problem referenced by the TODO, in parentheses. A comment explaining what there is to do is required.
-> Have a comment on every function that describes its purpose.

Naming
-> Use CapWords for class names, but lower_with_under.py for module names.
-> Use of underscores in names, not using any dashes.
-> Not using any single character names except for counters and iterators.
-> Prepending a single underscore (_) has some support for protecting module variables and functions (not included with import * from).
-> Prepending a double underscore (__) to an instance variable or method effectively serves to make the variable or method private to its class (using name mangling).
-> Don't abbreviate local variables (e.g., 'total' not 'tot')

Statements
-> Only one statement in a line.

Imports Formatting
-> Imports should be on separate lines.

WhiteSpacing
-> No whitespace inside parentheses, brackets or braces.
-> No whitespace before a comma, semicolon, or colon. Do use whitespace after a comma, semicolon, or colon except at the end of the line.
-> No whitespace before the open paren/bracket that starts an argument list, indexing or slicing.

Python Style Rules
-> Do not terminate your lines with semi-colons and do not use semi-colons to put two commands on the same line.
-> Indent your code blocks with 4 spaces.
-> Two blank lines between top-level definitions, one blank line between method definitions.
